# SSHBS
Small Stream Hydro-Biogeochemistry Simulator (SSHBS)

- SSHBS_library.R contains all model reference parameters based on reviewed literature and research experience
- SSHBS_initiation.R contains codes to initiate model stage variables
- SSHBS_simulation.R contains model output settings and model simulation codes
- "input" folder contains all input timeseries data and a model control file "GIS_channel_model_setup.csv"
- "channel_ratingTable.csv" contains all the channel hydraulic information, which can be generated by any channel hydraulic model, e.g., HEC-RAS.

Workflow:
- SSHBS_library.R contains all ecosystem parameters (review & update upon use)
- SSHBS_initiation.R  reads in channel morphology & hydraulic inputs and constructs model channels and hydraulic profile; Please see the files in the input folder
- SSHBS_simulation.R (this file) starts stream ecosystem and flow simulations in the constructed and initiated model channels; model outputs a csv file containing daily outputs per channel.
